# Kasic
The kasic programming language is an example of a basic but portable language. These docs describe how to use the kasic interpreter, and write code in the kasic programming language.

## A tour of Kasic
---
Kasic attempts to replicate some functionality of comman command line features. So much so that Kasic is built on the foundation of almost every expression being a command. Using the functionality of a command is similar to how the most comman Unix shells implement them. You can read more about Kasic commands [here](https://jackdelahunt.github.io/Kasic/commands.html).

Not only does Kasic replicate commands but also piping(`|`). The pipe allows commands to pass it's results to the next. Learning this functionality is key to using Kasic, you can learn more about it [here](https://jackdelahunt.github.io/Kasic/pipes.html).

Even though Kasic attempts to replicate the feel of a shell in a programming language it also attempts to add features. One of these features is `scopes`. Scopes are anotations for the programmer to use to group the functionality of commands together. Mastering how scopes work and how to use them can greatly improve the usability of Kasic. Read more about how to define and use them [here]().
